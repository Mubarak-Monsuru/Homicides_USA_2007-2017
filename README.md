The analyis of homicide data spanning from 2007 to 2017 reveals an upward trend in the rate of homicides, and there is a significant drop in arrest rates during the same time period. In 2007, over 50% of homicide cases resulted in arrests, but by 2017, arrest percentage had plummeted to less than 40%.

The analysis reveals nearly two-thirds of victims being black and a quarter of vivtims being either White or Hispanic. This accentuates the urgent need for government and law enforcement agencies to introduce more safety initiaves in predominantly black neighborhoods.
